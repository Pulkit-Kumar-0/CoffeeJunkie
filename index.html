    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>
    <img src="./images/house-blend.jpeg" alt="house blend" />
    <p style="width: 50%">
      House Blend coffee typically refers to a coffee blend that represents a
      café or roaster’s signature flavor profile. It is often designed to be
      versatile, balanced, and appealing to a broad range of coffee drinkers.
      House Blends are usually medium-roasted, which allows for a harmonious mix
      of flavors such as mild sweetness, subtle acidity, and nutty or chocolatey
      undertones. The specific beans used in a House Blend can vary, often
      combining coffee from different regions to create a unique, consistent
      taste. House Blend coffee is commonly used for drip coffee or pour-over
      brewing methods, making it a popular choice for daily consumption. It
      offers a crowd-pleasing flavor profile that is neither too bold nor too
      mild, making it an ideal option for both seasoned coffee enthusiasts and
      those new to specialty coffee. As the signature offering of many coffee
      shops, House Blends are crafted to reflect the character and quality of
      the roaster.

    <!-- French Roast -->
    <h3>French Roast</h3>

    <p style="width: 50%">
      French roast coffee refers to a coffee roasting style characterized by a
      very dark roast level. It is one of the darkest roasts available, often
      producing a deep, bold, and smoky flavor profile. French roast coffee is
      roasted longer than lighter roasts, resulting in an oily, dark brown,
      almost black bean. The extended roasting process caramelizes the natural
      sugars in the coffee, creating a smoky, sometimes bittersweet flavor with
      notes of dark chocolate or burnt caramel. It has less acidity than lighter
      roasts, but the original flavors of the coffee bean are largely
      overshadowed by the roasting process. The aroma of French roast coffee is
      often rich and intense, with a toasted or smoky scent. Contrary to popular
      belief, French roast coffee generally has slightly less caffeine than
      lighter roasts because the prolonged roasting process burns off some
      caffeine. The beans are shiny due to the oils brought to the surface
      during the roasting process. French roast coffee is often used for making
      strong, bold cups of drip coffee, espresso, or French press coffee. Its
      intense flavor makes it a popular choice for those who enjoy robust and
      full-bodied coffee. The name "French roast" is not tied to a specific
      origin of the coffee beans but rather to the roasting style, which became
      popular in France in the 19th century. It reflects a preference for
      darker, richer coffee in certain European cultures.

    <!-- Colombian Roast -->
    <h3>Colombian Roast</h3>
    <img src="./images/columbian-roast.jpeg" alt="columbian roast" />
    <p style="width: 50%">
      Colombian roast coffee refers to coffee that is made from beans grown in
      Colombia, a country renowned for producing high-quality coffee with a
      balanced and smooth flavor profile. Colombian coffee is typically
      medium-roasted to highlight its natural sweetness, mild acidity, and nutty
      or fruity undertones. The coffee beans are often processed using the wet
      or washed method, which enhances the clarity of their flavor. Colombian
      roast coffee is known for its rich aroma and smooth finish, making it a
      popular choice for coffee lovers around the world. Unlike French roast,
      Colombian roast focuses on preserving the original characteristics of the
      coffee bean rather than emphasizing the roasting process. This makes it an
      excellent option for those who prefer a well-rounded, aromatic, and
      versatile cup of coffee. Colombian coffee beans are often used in blends
      but are also celebrated as a single-origin brew due to their distinct and
      consistent quality.
